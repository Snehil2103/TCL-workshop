# TCL Scripting for Synthesis and Pre-Layout Timing Analysis in VLSI Design from Fundamentals to Advanced Techniques

Tool Command Language (TCL) is a powerful scripting language widely used in the field of VLSI for automating EDA tools. It is used for writing re-usable scripts for automating synthesis, PnR and timing analysis.

The Main goal of this repository is to develop a TCL script that takes a CSV file containing Design name, Output directory, Netlist directory, Early library path, Late library path and Constraints file to generate synthesized netlist and timing reports.
